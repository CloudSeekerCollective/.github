# We are the CloudSeeker Collective
The CloudSeeker Collective is a team of three people who create open source apps for general everyday use and implement interesting video game ideas.
## Chatrooms
Chatrooms is one of our biggest projects we have released so far - it is an open source chat app in which you can invite people to talk, collaborate or have fun without any unnecessary garbage implemented that will get in the way. It is designed to be simple, fast and lightweight, so that anybody can use it with ease.
## That interesting video game ideas part - what do you have cooking?
We have some games cooking right now, none of which are released yet though:

- Shots for Shots, a physics-based first person shooter where only skill matters - only one Pyramoid out of 75 may be victorious, or you can play 1v1 Duels to see who is the best out of 2 players.
- Fightopia, for which not much details are available yet - but we will reveal more soon!
- And 1 more unannounced game we are working on right now!
